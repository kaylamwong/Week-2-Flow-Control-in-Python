    "- Control flow statement in Python that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains True.\n",
    "- It's used when you don't know exactly how many times you need to loop, but you know the condition that must be met to stop the repetition.\n",
    "- While loops are a simpler loop construct than for loops. while loops repeat until the condition tested fails\n",
    "- If it is also important to know the position in the list, Python provides a function called enumerate that will iterate over a list (or other iterable) and return pairs of index and value."
